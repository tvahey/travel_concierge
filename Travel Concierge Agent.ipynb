The leap from \"responding\" to \"remembering\" defines the new frontier of **context engineering**. At its core, context engineering is about shaping what the model knows at any given moment. By managing what's stored, recalled, and injected into the model's working memory, we can make an agent that feels personal, consistent, and context-aware.\n","\n","The `RunContextWrapper` in the **OpenAI Agents SDK** provides the foundation for this. It allows developers to define structured state objects that persist across runs, enabling memory, notes, or even preferences to evolve over time. When paired with hooks and context-injection logic, this becomes a powerful system for **context personalization**—building agents that learn who you are, remember past actions, and tailor their reasoning accordingly.\n","\n","This cookbook shows a **state-based long-term memory** pattern:\n","\n","* **State object** = your local-first memory store (structured profile + notes)\n","* **Distill** memories during a run (tool call → session notes)\n","* **Consolidate** session notes into global notes at the end (dedupe + conflict resolution)\n","* **Inject** a well-crafted state at the start of each run (with precedence rules)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dIF_WXZcXnrb"},"source":["## Why Context Personalization Matters\n","\n","Context personalization is the **\"magic moment\"** when an AI agent stops feeling generic and starts feeling like *your* agent.\n","\n","It's when the system remembers your coffee order, your company's tone of voice, your past support tickets, or your preferred aisle seat—and uses that knowledge naturally, without being prompted.\n","\n","From a user perspective, this builds trust and delight: the agent appears to genuinely understand them. From a company perspective, it creates a **strategic moat**—a way to continuously capture, refine, and apply high-quality behavioral data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ND5SGAhoXnrc"},"source":["## Real-World Scenario: Travel Concierge Agent\n","\n","We'll ground this tutorial in a **travel concierge** agent that helps users book flights, hotels, and car rentals with a high degree of personalization.\n","\n","In this tutorial, you'll build an agent that:\n","\n","* starts each session with a structured user profile and curated memory notes\n","* captures new durable preferences (for example, \"I'm vegetarian\") via a dedicated tool\n","* consolidates those preferences into long-term memory at the end of each run\n","* resolves conflicts using a clear precedence order: **latest user input → session overrides → global defaults**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FseiU7zIXnrc"},"source":["## AI Memory Architecture Decisions\n","\n","### 1. Retrieval-Based vs State-Based Memory\n","\n","State-based memory is better suited than retrieval-based memory for a travel concierge AI agent because travel decisions depend on continuity, priorities, and evolving preferences—not ad-hoc search. A travel agent must reason over a *current, coherent user state* (loyalty programs, seat preferences, budgets, visa constraints, trip intent, and temporary overrides like \"this time I want to sleep\") and consistently apply it across flights, hotels, insurance, and follow-ups.\n","\n","### 2. Shape of a Memory\n","\n","The shape of an agent's memory is entirely driven by the use case. A reliable way to design it is to start with a simple question:\n","\n","> *If this were a human agent performing the same task, what would they actively hold in working memory to get the job done?*\n","\n","### 3. Memory Scope\n","\n","Separate memory by **scope** to reduce noise and make evolution safer over time:\n","\n","- **User-Level Memory (Global Notes)**: Durable preferences that should persist across sessions\n","- **Session-Level Memory (Session Notes)**: Short-lived or contextual information relevant only to the current interaction\n","\n","### 4.
